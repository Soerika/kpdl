# Self-supervised Learning of Dense Hierarchical Representations for Medical Image Segmentation
This repository is the implementation of the paper 'Self-supervised Learning of Dense Hierarchical Representations for Medical Image Segmentation' submitted to ISBI 2024.

Current version of code is fully-functional but still requiers adaptation for easy usage, writing documentation and some grooming.  

Code is based on [vox2vec repo](https://github.com/mishgon/vox2vec).
